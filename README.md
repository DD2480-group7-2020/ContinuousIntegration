# Test Final
This project is a continuous integration (CI) server integrated with Github and Firebase. At the moment, it is able to test and build small projects.

# Running
To run the backend server, go to the backend directory and use the command `npm start`.

To run the frontend server, go to the frontend directory and use the command `npm start`

To run the tests, use `npm test`

To generate the documentation, use `npm docs`

# Configuration
There are several different config files for this project. The `config.json` is used to provide shell scripts in three stages. `install` is used to to install project dependencies. `syntax` is used for syntax checking and building the project. `tests` is used for running unit tests and such. A successful build must pass all three stages. If no script is provided for a certain stages, then it automatically passes said stage.

The `config_server.json` contains three keys. `token` is used to connect with the [github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/). `database` is used to provide a link to the database from the github status message. Finally, `build_path_prefix` is used to set a custom build folder location of the tested project.

The final configuration is inlined in `src/controllersfirebase_controller.js` and is the firebase configuration config which contains api keys and such.
